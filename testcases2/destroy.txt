/*
 * SLInsert inserts a given data item 'newObj' into a SortedList while maintaining the
 *   order and uniqueness of list items.
 * 
 * SLInsert "a50680&&&"  and should return 1 if 'newObj' is not equal to any other items in the list and
 *   was successfully inserted.
 * SLInsert should return 0 if 'newObj' is equal to an item already in the list or it was
 *   not successfully inserted
 *
 * Data item equality should be tested with the user's comparator function *
