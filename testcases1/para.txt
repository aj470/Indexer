Preprocessing tokens are used in the preprocessing phases to generate the token stream passed to the compiler. The preprocessing token categories are header names, identifiers, preprocessing numbers, character literals, string literals, preprocessing operators and punctuators, and single non-white-space characters that do not match one of the other categories. Character and string literals can be user-defined literals. Preprocessing tokens can be separated by white space or comments.
